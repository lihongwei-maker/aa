    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! This tutorial explains how to impletment the [Neural-Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) algorithm developed by Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker and Matthias Bethge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neural what?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Neural-Style, or Neural-Transfert, is an algorithm that taks as input a content-image (e.g. a tortle), a style-image (e.g. artistic waves) and return the content of the content-image as if it was 'painted' using the artistic style of the style-image:\n",
    "\n",
    "![content1](images/neuralstyle.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The principe is simple: we define two distances, one for the content ($D_C$) and one for the style ($D_S$). $D_C$ measues how different is the content between two images, while $D_S$ measures how different is the style between two images. Then, we take a third image, the input, (e.g. a with noise), and we transform it in order to both minimize its content-distance with the content-image and its style-distance with the style-image. \n",
    "\n",
    "### OK. How does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, going further requires some mathematics. Let $C_{nn}$ be a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network and $X$ be any image. $C_{nn}(X)$ is the network fed by $X$ (containing feature maps at all layers). Let $F_{XL} \\in C_{nn}(X)$ be the feature maps at depth layer $L$, all vectorized and concatenated in one single vector. We simply define the content of $X$ at layer $L$ by $F_{XL}$. Then, if $Y$ is another image of same the size than $X$, we define the distance of content at layer $L$ as follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$D_C^L(X,Y) = \\|F_{XL} - F_{YL}\\|^2 = \\sum_i (F_{XL}(i) - F_{YL}(i))^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $F_{XL}(i)$ is the $i^{th}$ element of $F_{XL}$. The style is a bit less trivial to define. Let $F_{XL}^k$ with $k \\leq K$ be the vectorized $k^{th}$ of the $K$ feature maps at layer $L$. The style $G_{XL}$ of $X$ at layer $L$ is defined by the Gram produce of all vectorized feature maps $F_{XL}^k$ with $k \\leq K$. In other words, $G_{XL}$ is a $K$x$K$ matrix and the element $G_{XL}(k,l)$ at the $k^{th}$ line and $l^{th}$ column of $G_{XL}$ is the vectorial produce between  $F_{XL}^k$ and $F_{XL}^l$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$G_{XL}(k,l) = \\langle F_{XL}^k, F_{XL}^l\\rangle = \\sum_i F_{XL}^k(i) . F_{XL}^l(i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $F_{XL}^k(i)$ is the $i^{th}$ element of $F_{XL}^k$. We can see $G_{XL}(k,l)$ as a measure of the correlation between feature maps $k$ and $l$. In that way, $G_{XL}$ represents the correlation matrix of feature maps of $X$ at layer $L$. Note that the size of $G_{XL}$ only depends on the number of feature maps, not on the size of $X$. Then, if $Y$ is another image *of any size*, we define the distance of style at layer $L$ as follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$D_S^L(X,Y) = \\|G_{XL} - G_{YL}\\|^2 = \\sum_{k,l} (F_{XL}(k,l) - F_{YL}(k,l))^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to minimize in one shot $D_C(X,C)$ between a variable image $X$ and target content-image $C$ and $D_S(X,S)$ between $X$ and target style-image $S$, both computed at several layers , we compute and sum the gradients (derivative with respect to $X$) of each distance at each wanted layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\nabla_{\\textit{total}}(X,S,C) = \\sum_{L_C} w_{CL_C}.\\nabla_{\\textit{content}}^{L_C}(X,C) + \\sum_{L_S} w_{SL_S}.\\nabla_{\\textit{style}}^{L_S}(X,S)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $L_C$ and $L_S$ are respectivement the wanted layers (arbitrary stated) of content and style and $w_{CL_C}$ and $w_{SL_S}$ the weights (arbitrary stated) associated with the style or the content at each wanted layer. Then, we run a gradient descent over $X$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X \\leftarrow X - \\alpha \\nabla_{\\textit{total}}(X,S,C)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok. That's enough with maths. If you want to go deeper (how to compute the gradients) **we encourage you to read the original paper** by Leon A. Gatys and AL, where everything is much better and much clearer explained. For our implementation in PyTorch, we already have everything we need: indeed, with PyTorch, all the gradients are automatically and dynamically computed for you (while you use functions from the library). This is why the implementation of this algorithm becomes very confortable with PyTorch. \n",
    "\n",
    "## PyTorch implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not sure to understand all the mathematics above, you will probably get it by implementing it. If you are discovering PyTorch, we recommend you to first read this [Introduction to PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/tutorials/blob/master/Deep%20Learning%20with%20PyTorch.ipynb).\n",

Hence, the weight $w_{CL}$ and the target content $F_{CL}$ are parameters of the function. We implement this function as a torch module with a constructor that takes these parameters as input. The distance $\\|F_{XL} - F_{YL}\\|^2$ is the Mean Square Error between the two sets of feature maps, that can be computed using a criterion `nn.MSELoss` stated as a third parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will add our content losses at each desired layer as additive modules of the neural network. That way, each time we will feed the network with an input image $X$, all the content losses will be computed at the desired layers and, thanks to autograd, all the gradients will be computed. For that, we just need to make the `forward` method of our module returning the input: the module becomes a ''transparent layer'' of the neural network. The computed loss is saved as a parameter of the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we define a fake `backward` method, that just call the backward method of `nn.MSELoss` in order to reconstruct the gradient. This method returns the computed loss: this will be usefull when running the gradien descent in order to display the evolution of style and content losses."

    "Let's use an Adam optimizer with a learning rate 0.01 to run our gradient descent. Unlike training a network, we want to train the input image in order to minimise the content/style losses. We would like to simply create a PyTorch Adam optimizer, passing our image as the variable to optimize. But `optim.Adam` takes as first argument a list of PyTorch `Variable` that require gradient. Our input image is a `Variable` but is not a leaf of the tree that requires computatioon of gradients. In order to show that this variable requires a gradient, a possibility is to construct a `Parameter` object from the input image. Then, we just give a list containing this `Parameter` to the optimizer's constructor:"

Indeed, there is a last trick: the resulting optimized image takes its values between $-\\infty$ and $+\\infty$ instead of staying between 0 and 1. In other words, the image is well optimized, but has absurd values. In fact, we must perform an optimization under constraints in order to keep having right vaues into our input image. There is a simple solution: at each step, to correct the image to maintain its values into the 0-1 interval. "
