PyTorch Tutorials
-----------------


1. [Deep Learning with PyTorch: a 60-minute blitz](Deep%20Learning%20with%20PyTorch.ipynb)
   - A perfect introduction to PyTorch's torch, autograd, nn and optim APIs
   - If you are a former Torch user, you can check out this instead: [Introduction to PyTorch for former Torchies](Introduction%20to%20PyTorch%20for%20former%20Torchies.ipynb)
2. Custom C extensions
   - [Write your own C code that interfaces into PyTorch via FFI](Creating%20Extensions%20using%20FFI.md)
3. [Writing your own neural network module that uses numpy and scipy](Creating%20extensions%20using%20numpy%20and%20scipy.ipynb)
4. [Reinforcement (Q-)Learning with PyTorch](Reinforcement%20(Q-)Learning%20with%20PyTorch.ipynb)
