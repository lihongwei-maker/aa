    "\n",
    "This jupyter notebook can be run on any computer with a standard browser and no prior installation of any programming language is required. It can run remotely over the Internet, free of charge, thanks to Google Colaboratory. To connect with Colab, click on one of the two blue checkboxes above. Check that \"colab\" appears in the address bar. You can right-click on \"Open in Colab\" and select \"Open in new tab\" if the left click does not work for you. Familiarize yourself with the drop-down menus near the top of the window. You can edit the notebook during the session, for example substituting your own image files for the image files used in this demo. Experiment by changing the parameters of functions. It is not possible for an ordinary user to permanently change this version of the notebook on GitHub or Colab, so you cannot inadvertently mess it up. Use the notebook's File Menu if you wish to save your own (changed) notebook!\n",

    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we show how to perform patch-level prediction using deep learning models. To do that, we use the patch prediction module from TIAToolbox. It can perform patch prediction for pre-extracted image patches or larger image tiles / whole-slide images (WSIs), where image patches are extracted on the fly. WSI patch-level predictions can subsequently be aggregated to obtain a segmentation map. The module `patch_predictor` ([details](https://tia-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html?highlight=patch_predictor#module-tiatoolbox.models.engine.patch_predictor)) receive a patch and segment it into different labels. \n",

Here we specify the WSI's level as `'baseline'`, which is equivalent to level 0. In general, this is the level of greatest resolution. In this particular case, the image has only one level. More information can be found in the [documentation](https://tia-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html?highlight=WSIReader.read_rect#tiatoolbox.wsicore.wsireader.WSIReader.read_rect).\n",

If the mask of a particular WSI is specified as `None`, then the labels for all patches of that WSI (even background regions)  would be predicted. This could cause unnecessary computation.\n",
    "- `merge_predictions`: You can set this parameter to `True` if you wish to generate a 2D map of patch classification results. However, for big WSIs you might need a large amount of memory available to do this on the file. An alternative (default) solution is to set `merge_predictions=False`, and then generate the 2D prediction maps using `merge_predictions` function as you will see later on.\n",

We first need to merge patch prediction outputs and then visualize them as an overlay on the original image. As before, the `merge_predictions` method is used to merge the patch predictions. Here we set the parameters `resolution=1.25, units='power'` to generate the prediction map at 1.25x magnification. If you would like to have higher/lower resolution (bigger/smaller) prediction maps, you need to change these parameters accordingly. When the predictions are merged, use the `overlay_patch_prediction` function to overlay the prediction map on the WSI thumbnail, which should be extracted at the same resolution used for prediction merging. \n",
