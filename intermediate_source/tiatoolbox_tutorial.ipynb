    "\n",
    "This jupyter notebook can be run on any computer with a standard browser and no prior installation of any programming language is required. It can run remotely over the Internet, free of charge, thanks to Google Colaboratory. To connect with Colab, click on one of the two blue checkboxes above. Check that \"colab\" appears in the address bar. You can right-click on \"Open in Colab\" and select \"Open in new tab\" if the left click does not work for you. Familiarize yourself with the drop-down menus near the top of the window. You can edit the notebook during the session, for example substituting your own image files for the image files used in this demo. Experiment by changing the parameters of functions. It is not possible for an ordinary user to permanently change this version of the notebook on GitHub or Colab, so you cannot inadvertently mess it up. Use the notebook's File Menu if you wish to save your own (changed) notebook!\n",

    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we show how to perform patch-level prediction using deep learning models. To do that, we use the patch prediction module from TIAToolbox. It can perform patch prediction for pre-extracted image patches or larger image tiles / whole-slide images (WSIs), where image patches are extracted on the fly. WSI patch-level predictions can subsequently be aggregated to obtain a segmentation map. The module `patch_predictor` ([details](https://tia-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html?highlight=patch_predictor#module-tiatoolbox.models.engine.patch_predictor)) receive a patch and segment it into different labels. \n",

    "## Get predictions for patches within an image tile\n",
    "\n",
    "We now demonstrate how to obtain patch-level predictions for a large image tile. It is quite a common practice in computational pathology to divide a large image into several patches (often overlapping) and then aggregate the results to generate a prediction map for different regions of the large image. As we are making a prediction per patch again, there is no need to instantiate a new `PatchPredictor` class. However, we should tune the `predict` input arguments to make them suitable for tile prediction. The `predict` function then automatically extracts patches from the large image tile and predicts the label for each of them. As the `predict` function can accept multiple tiles in the input to be processed and each input tile has potentially many patches, we save results in a file when more than one image is provided. This is done to avoid any problems with limited computer memory. However, if only one image is provided, the results will be returned as in `patch` mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we try this function on a sample image tile. For this example, we use a tile that was released with the [Kather et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.1038/srep27988) paper. It has been already downloaded in the Download section of this notebook.\n",
